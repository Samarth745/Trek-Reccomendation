1,Friendship Peak Expedition,Himachal Pradesh,8,6,34 KM,5289 mts.,32400,Manali to Manali,"
Brief Description 

A springboard for hardcore mountaineering, Friendship Peak runs in some influential circles. Nestled comfortably in between all the biggies from the two major ranges - Pir Panjal and the Dhauladhar, Friendship Peak is an amphitheater for the tallest mountains in both these ranges. With a bird’s eye view of Manali from the col, to the mountain ranges in Lahaul from its peak; Friendship peak faces Hanuman Tibba on the one side and finds as its neighbours, giants such as Indrasan, Deo Tibba, Priyadarshani, the Seven Sisters to name a few. 
The Friendship Peak trek is more than just a pretty view from the top. Standing tall at 5289 M, it falls in the largest range of the Lesser Himalayas - the Pir Panjal. Apart from humbly standing its ground in the midst of the 6000ers, we especially are in awe of the trail of the trek which takes us through the most mesmerizing visuals. We encounter alpine meadows, thick forests and wide clearings, crossings over icy cold mountain streams - and of course a thick bed of shimmering white snow - all packed in 34 kms. It has stunning campsites full of local wildlife and bursts of colors, waiting to be wandered and explored.  Even the landscape buried under a thick sheet of snow is anything but wearisome to look at. 
Read: Highlights of Friendship Peak
Walking through glacial moraines, navigating our way around massive snow rocks, the unpredictable weather and the brutal slopes keep the journey exhilarating throughout. Friendship peak is not short of an expedition for its difficult terrain, harsh temperature and a continuously steep ascent from the time you set your first foot out the Summit Camp tent.  Each season on the peak is met with different kinds of challenges and hence, different visuals and a completely different experience. 
Although identified as a trekking peak by IMF, do not let the altitude of Friendship Peak deceive you. It is no less hard to please than the 6000ers in it vicinity and hence should only be attempted by experienced trekkers with a know-how of basic mountain skills and prior experience in high altitudes. From carrying your own load to a need for technical knowledge, the peak requires the acumen and grit of a mountaineer, its considerably lesser height helping you shift gears from trekking to mountaineering with ease.
The grueling climb requires learning new skills; using an ice-axe, pitching a tent in snow, roping up, working together as a team and even seemingly simple tasks like ‘walking’ - on snow, on a steep gradient, in shin-high, extremely heavy snow boots. With the constantly changing weather, we never know when we will be hit by our next snow storm, white-out or torrentuous rains - which makes the trek even more thrilling while also, adding to its level of difficulty.

The best months for this trek are May and June for a snow-covered peak and September and October for a predominantly rocky terrain.

Brief Description 

                        Pin Parvati Pass, a trans-Himalayan trek, is one of the toughest cross overs treks in the country, meant for seasoned trekkers looking for a challenge. It is your passage between two distinct worlds - that from the abundant and alive Parvati valley which starts at the confluence of Parvati river and Beas river in Himachal Pradesh to the dry, resilient and almost galactic Pin Valley in Spiti (the cold desert). And the reward for getting to the highest point of the trek – the Pass (5,298M) - is that you get a look into both the worlds at the same time. The prayer flags, the panoramic view with the assault of greens on the one side and browns on the other, while you find yourself in knee deep white snow, is an experience like no other. This is the reason why Pin Parvati Pass continues to remain our most favorite cross-over trek in the country! 

The trail of Pin Parvati starts at Bhuntar which, a town in the Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh. The Bhuntar airport connects the place to most major cities like Delhi and Chandigarh. Starting at 2,000M, The trek takes you to an astounding height of 5,289M and descends down on the other side to a small village in Spiti, by the name of Mudh (3,810 M). The experience is no less than witnessing a multitude of dimensions in a span of 12 days. Pin Parvati is a popular trail and not without good reason, too. It is a trek which marries beauty to adventure for its exquisite landscapes and its challenging terrain. The beauty of the trek is hypnotic along with it being a challenging endeavor. This trail that takes you through all kinds of terrain – forests, meadows, streams, waterfalls, glaciers and the arid lands of Spiti, is a visual lesson in the coexistence of extremes. Be prepared for an overstimulation of all your senses!

But this trek is not just about the stunning differences in landscape. It also introduces you to two distinct Himalayan cultures - the livelihoods, structure of houses, lifestyles – as you traverse from one side of the mountain to the other. The realization that communities and cultures are a product of their environment is a sheer revelation you will witness on this trek. 

Rife with poetry and drama, this trek is a much more challenging endeavor than its sister trek Pin Bhaba Pass (4,915M) which is much shorter and easier in terms of terrain and altitude gain. The length of the trek, the long distances, the demanding terrain and high vertical gains every day make the trek suitable for seasoned trekkers with extensive experience in the Himalayas. If you are a frequent trekker in the Himalayas, are familiar with altitude and acclimatization related difficulties and are looking for your next challenge, Pin Parvati Pass would be an excellent choice to make.

The best time to do this trek is between June and September. This is what makes the trek even more special. It is one of the few Himalayan treks which can be done in monsoons and hence allows you a window into the rich, monsoon landscape of the region.

17,Brahmatal Trek ,Uttarakhand,6,3,35 KM,3856 mts.,8900,Lohajung to Lohajung,"
Brief Description 

Resting in the depths of the Uttarakhand Himalayas, the Brahmatal trek treats you to soaring views of some lofty mountain peaks such as Mt. Trishul, Mt Nanda Ghunti and Mt. Khamet. At an altitude of 3800 m, the Brahmatal trek is open throughout the winters when most of the other trekking routes are closed making it a perfect winter trek for beginners.
Brahmatal hosts one of the loveliest forest walks that are home to diverse bird species and century old oak trees. During spring, the trails of these forests are carpeted in the red and pink blooms of rhododendrons. In winters, the landscape transforms dramatically sheathing the region in pristine white snow, making it nothing short of a Winter wonderland.
Long, never-ending ridgelines, expansive meadows, and 360-degree views of colossal peaks from the summit are some of the other attractions of the Brahmatal Trek. Read more about the Highlights of the Trek here. 
Spanning over 28 km, the Brahmatal trek begins from the base village of Lohajung located in the Chamoli district in Garhwal Himalayas. The 6 km trek from Lohajung to the Gujreni campsite runs through dense forests of Conifer, Cedar, Oak and Fir. The Gujreni campsite is at the heart of a beautiful clearing surrounded by Oak and Rhododendrons with panoramic views of snow-capped ranges.
The next day, the trek gradient increases gradually. A 2-hour trek will lead you to the Bekaltal lake, frozen during the winter months, making up for a tranquil view.
The trail heading out of the lake continues to remain dominated by Oak and Rhododendron forests. You start catching glimpses of Mt Trishul through the woods from here on. The forest soon opens up to an expansive meadow, Talindi Top, that rewards you with spectacular views of Mt. Trishul and Mt. Nanda Ghunti amongst others. The ascent continues beyond this point until you reach Jhandi Top which surpasses the views offered by Talindi Top. It is a 1.5 km descent from here onwards to the Brahmatal campsite. The campsite is delightfully set at one end of a ridge, opening up to a stunning view of the blue silhouette of mountain ranges stacked layer after layer at the horizon. The Brahmatal lake is only 500 M from the campsite. According to legend, the lake is believed to be the place where Lord Brahma meditated ages ago.
The trek to the summit begins the next day and is nothing short of thrilling. The trail climbs through moderately inclined dense forests eventually translating into a ridge stretch that opens up to gaping views of the tremendous valley behind. The summit offers awe-inspiring vistas of some well-known Himalayan ranges like Mount Trishul, sacred Mount Nanda Ghunti, Mount Chaukhamba, Mount Neelkanth, Mount Kamet and Mount Hathi Ghoda.
While the trail is relatively easy to navigate, the ascent to Brahmatal Top can be challenging during heavy snowfall season. The snow, during these times can run knee deep requiring some effort during ascent and descent.

Brief Description 

                        Located in Hemis National Park, Kang Yatse II, at 6,250M, is the shorter of the two cousins with Kang Yatse I towering beside it at 6,400M. As one of the highest trekking peaks in the vast expanse of the arid terrain in Ladakh, Kang Yatse II makes itself seen on day 6 of our trek as we make our way to its base through Markha Valley.  The peak is a thing of sheer beauty standing tall in the middle of this dry land of scree and loose rocks.
Starting from the high mountain city of Leh, you are in the presence of beauty from the get-go. The drive up to Skiu, the confluence of the distinctly colored rivers - Zanskar and Indus, the occasional sighting of wildlife that’s endemic to the region, the excruciatingly dry yet gorgeous trek through Markha Valley to finally reach the slopes of this much sought after peak which is 6,250M of beauty that’s hard to ignore once you lay your eyes on it. Passing through quaint settlements scattered across this arid landscape give you a glimpse into the local culture and livelihood of the region. Religious shrines, mani walls, stupas and other signs of the faith of the land and its people, pepper the landscape. The prayer flags add to the color palette of this otherwise monochromatic backdrop. They also lend a sense of peace to the continuously thinning air as we go up towards the higher reaches of this exquisite peak. This mud civilization is not short of old monasteries, ruined forts and abandoned structures which camouflage themselves amongst the peculiar geographical formations in the region adding to the mystery of the place. While most of the trek is long distances on a harsh terrain, the toughest day of the entire trek remains summit day when we gain an altitude of 1,200M in a single go.
The climb back down through the high altitude pass – Kongmaru La which lies at an elevation of 5,236M is yet another feature of the trek which single-handedly holds the capacity to push it straight to the top of your must-do list. The climb up to Kongmaru La pass is a few patches of steep incline between long distances of flat land rich in pikus and marmots and provides for magnificent views of Kang Yatse I, Kang Yatse II and Dzo Jongo. Adorned with prayer flags, the wind on the pass is fierce. The descent from the pass goes through deep gorges and water crossings with the valley appearing and disappearing on every turn. The terrain is interesting in its colours with rocks spread across the colour palette, geological formations with massive walls standing vertically on either side of you and the gush of water filling up these narrow passageways to the strangest and most interesting fauna you will ever see. 
Kang Yatse is a trekking peak meaning it does not require the use of technical equipment and technical skills. But, given the level of endurance required and its high altitude, this trek is for experienced climbers only. June to September are the best months to attempt this peak.

40,Borasu Pass Trek,Uttarakhand,9,5,63 KM,5360 mts.,29200,Sankri to Chitkul,"
Brief Description 

Located along the border with Tibet, the Borasu Pass trek is a virgin trail which presents some of the best views of the historical Swargarohini peak. As a new trail in our portfolio, what we are most excited about is that it is one of the lesser explored trails in the region connecting two very distinct valleys of two geographically rich states. Borasu Pass trek starts from the small village of Sankri in Uttarakhand and ends at the gorgeous hamlet, Chitkul, tucked away in the many folds of the mountains in Himachal Pradesh. The trail for this high mountain pass takes you through the infamous Har ki Dun Valley. With an abundance of fauna housed by colourful birds and surrounded by splendid peaks, Har ki Dun is one of the most beautiful all-season treks in the Himalayas. The Borasu Pass trek gives you the opportunity to continue on this exquisite trail onto a lesser explored route to the pass which connects Tons Valley in Uttarakhand with Baspa Valley in Himachal Pradesh. It being an extension of one of the most beautiful trails, is only one of half a dozen reasons you should consider this trek as your next adventure! 
This ancient trade route between Uttarakhand and Himachal offers you a variety of landscapes that are sure to leave you awestruck. Passing through small mountain habitations of Taluka, Gangaad, Dhatmir, Seema and Osla, the trek takes you through dense forests rife with chestnut, walnut, willows and chinar trees. It passes through an assortment of landscapes such as terraced mountain fields, massive patches of tall grass and thick coniferous forests. Our favourite part about this high-altitude pass, which lies barely explored at an elevation of 5,200M; is that it provides for the best views but will make you sweat for them! 
A stunning mix of green meadows and vast fields of snow, packed with jumpy rivers and solemn glaciers, Borasu Pass is an easy trek made extremely difficult by its treacherous terrain. As we were walking the trail, the one thing that struck us was that this trek is a complete 360-degree ride. Starting from greens leading into browns spilling into whites it takes a turn-around after the pass, to go from whites to browns to eventually reach the lush green valley by the Baspa river into Chitkul in the Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh.
It is a difficult climb, however. The long distances between camps, steep narrow ridges and its heavily bouldered terrain with patches of glaciers full of open and hidden crevasses, all lend to making it a strenuous affair. Its steep ascends and descends and the high altitude can get technical and hence we believe that the trail demands prior experience in the Himalayas along with some specific skills.
From our explorations, the best months to undertake Borasu Pass Trek are May, June, September and October. Stay on this page for more information on the Borasu Pass Trek.

Brief Description 

Burrowed deep within the leafy jungles of the Kanchenjunga National Park, the coveted Goechala trek takes one disarmingly close to the third highest mountain range in the world.
Getting close to the legendary Mt. Kanchenjunga is not the only reason this trek remains a favourite amongst both trekkers and trek leaders alike. What fascinates us most about this trek is how up-close and life size some of the celebrated peaks of the Himalayas appear on this trail. For example, on the fifth day of the trek, we will be camping right at the foot of Mt. Pandim. By the time we get to the summit day, the peak of Mt. Pandim appears deceptively near, as if it is only a day’s hike away!
Topping the thrill of being in the vicinity of such gigantic peaks is the fierce alpenglow one gets to witness on the trail. Watching these otherwise unyielding peaks, especially Mt. Kanchenjunga, melt into molten gold right in front of you, under the early morning rays of the sun is an experience that remains etched in the back of your head for a lifetime.
Long suspension bridges running in the midst of dense jungles, a tranquil monastery at 3000 M, and a serene mirror like lake that sits right below the summit point are some of the other joys of the Goechala Trek. Read more about the attractions of the Goechala Trek here.
Climbing up to an altitude of 4600 M, the Goechala trek is as challenging as is beautiful. Read more about the difficulty level of the trek, the challenges one encounters on the trail and the skillset one requires to traverse the untrammelled terrain of Goechala effortlessly here.

Brief Description 

                        Nestled deep in Gangotri National Park, Gangotri III at an impressive altitude of 6,577M stands tall amongst its two sister peaks Gangotri I (6672M) and Gangotri II (6590M). Rising from the Rudugaira Bamak Glacier, Gangotri III is bound by Mt. Rudragaira to its right and the mighty Auden's Col Pass to the left in the Garhwal range of Himalayas. For its altitude, expedition style climbing using mountaineering equipment, and awe-inspiring views of famed peaks in the range, Gangotri III offers some of the best mountaineering experiences. 
A stepping stone for some and for some a challenge in and of itself, the mountain is a thing of beauty and does its share in lending you a dream. It is a challenging endeavor taken on by climbers looking to get a taste of high-altitude climbing and for those preparing for 7000+M peaks in the Himalayas. 
A climb up Gangotri III includes having to traverse miles of rocky moraines, navigating the mighty Gangotri glacier, walking across crevassed snowfields and an arduous climb up the summit with sections of vertical ice fall in the thinning high-altitude air coupled with violent winds. Since it is a technical climb which requires specific knowledge of mountaineering equipment and a specific set of skills to survive at that altitude in that terrain, this is an expedition reserved for experienced climbers only. Mountaineering certification or alternatively experience in high-altitude mountaineering and extreme temperature is a mandate to undertake this challenging expedition.

Brief Description 

                        Auden’s Col is the holy grail of trekking in the Western Himalayas - hailed by many as being more difficult than Kalindi Khal, which is one of the most dangerous treks in India. As a mountain pass hanging at the impressive altitude of 5,490M, this impossibly high, glaciated pass between the ginormous Gangotri and Jogin massifs is the climax of a long, treacherous journey between the pilgrimage towns of Gangotri and Kedarnath.
Starting from the high mountain town of Gangotri, which is possibly one of the best trailheads in the country, the trek takes you high in the Garhwal Himalayas in the massive Gangotri glacial region. The mighty Bhagirathi flows loud and proud, from its glacial source at the foot of Chaukhamba, down through vast meadows and dense deodar forests. Auden’s Col is by no means a monotonous landscape. You climb through dense birch and oak forests on the first day, onto vast, unending meadows with panoramic views of the Gangotri and Jogin peaks. You leave the meadows for harsh, alpine terrain - over moraine fields with hidden lakes, onto steep snow slopes for the final pass climb. Once you climb the pass, you walk through one of the most heavily glaciated regions in India - the crevassed Khatling glacier. Then back onto moraine and through dense forests once again before visiting the holy Vasuki Tal lake and the snow-covered Mayali Pass.
The first crossing of Auden’s Col, through this beautiful trail which links the Khatling and Rudra valleys was made by J.B. Auden, a British surveyor, in the year 1939 with the next recorded passing of the col, a long 44 years after. With everything that’s challenging and awesome about Auden’s Col - the glaciated approach, the lush and beautiful lower valleys, the unending moraine, and the magnificent views, the pass remains one of the least explored in the country even today. 
On the one hand, the trek is an easy pick for its scanty crowds and a perfect assortment of beautiful landscapes along with unmatched views of revered peaks in the range. But on the other hand, it is feared to be a hostile trail where the dangers encountered outweigh the scenic beauty of the terrain. For the distance covered and altitude gained each day, there are no ‘easy’ days here. The trek requires immense patience, and doesn’t forgive those who don’t acclimatize well. 
That being said, this trek brimming with raw beauty and laborious challenges, is perfect for seasoned trekkers looking to step up their trekking game in the Himalayas.

As per local beliefs, Deo Tibba is the assembly site of the gods and the 'Devtas' are believed to sit on this peak. Although it qualifies as a serious mountaineering expedition with a huge ice cap on its summit, it has a relatively easy approach and logistics. Being just over 6000 M, Mt. Deo Tibba has an extensive ice cap at the peak but the actual summit happens over a snow hump located at the edge of the ice plateau. This expedition involves crossing over an icy pass, towards a glacier with a rocky moraine at a steep slope of about 55 degrees which requires fixed ropes to traverse this obstacle safely. Due to its challenging terrain and expedition style trekking, Mt.

With the aid of local trackers and guides this adventurous expedition goes in search of Snow Leopards amid the mountains of Hemis National Park in Ladakh. This is a physically demanding holiday but the rewards will be the truly spectacular mountain scenery of the ancient kingdom of Ladakh and a real chance of finding this high altitude predator as it follows the resident Bharal, or Blue Sheep, to more accessible lower elevations for the winter months.The snow leopard found singly, inhabiting the most inaccessible terrain of rugged mountains, preferably steep terrain broken by cliffs midges and gullies. In the winter their main attraction is the livestock nearby villages, because of high mountains covered by snow most of the wildlife descent to search of grassing and water. The Snow Leopard Trek in Ladakh is best-done between the months of December to March. Stay on this page for more information on the Ladakh Snow Leopard Trek.

With a jaw-dropping length of 100 km and 6 staggering 5000M+ mountain passes and three high altitude oligotrophic lakes, the Rumtse to Tso Moriri Trek is unlike any other trek in Ladakh, the land of high passes and mountains.

With lengthy walks, steep ascents and descents over passes, the Rumtse to Tso Moriri trek demands high physical fitness and one must be able to acclimatize properly to the high altitudes of Ladakh. The landscapes change shape from time to time with a cascade of colors that make them look like rainbow mountains. The area also hosts some of the rarest wildlife like Wild Asses, Blue Sheep, and Marmots which run around freely along with rare Snow Leopard spotting if one is lucky. The incomprehensibly massive valleys and unusual terrain of the Changthang valley of Ladakh are what makes the Rumtse to Tso Moiriri trek special.

57,Mt. Nun Peak,Ladakh,23,8,64 KM,7135 mts.,220000,Leh to Leh,"
Brief Description 

If you are looking to transition from trekking peaks to climbing technical peaks, Mount Nun is your best bet. As the highest peak in the Zanskar Valley of Ladakh, Mount Nun is 7,135 meters of sheer energy. You can feel its strength from the very moment you lay your eyes on it. It continues to silently exude its authority by the way of its daunting structure, unnerving slopes, unannounced blizzards and the peculiar way that it holds you, sometimes gently but on others, decidedly not. This handsome mountain is part of the Nun Kun massif and shares its space with its shorter twin Mt. Kun (7, 077 M); separated from each other by a 4 km long snow plateau. The massif is located in Suru valley of the Kargil district about 250 km east of Srinagar.
Himalayas are an inexhaustible treasure house to which devotees of mountaineering have come for years to quench their thirst for exciting challenges. Amongst the many discovered and countless undiscovered peaks, stands Mt. Nun which draws climbers from across countries. A stepping stone for some and for some a challenge in and of itself, the mountain is a thing of beauty and does its share in lending you a dream. First scaled way back in 1953, it is a technical climb which requires navigating difficult terrain in extreme cold, with throes of violent winds being a bully - pushing you around in all directions.
The nature of the mountain, it's crevasse- riddled surface, it's very unnerving habit of changing face every hour thereby changing routes, elaborate glacial formations, high gradient ice walls, technical patches, knife-edge ridges, constantly changing weather, high altitude and strong winds make it a much tougher peak to climb than some other 7,000M peaks and is a very demanding peak. The mountain only welcomes a person with true grit and a heart of a team player.
Since it is a technical climb which requires specific knowledge of mountaineering equipment and a specific set of skills to survive at that altitude in that terrain, this is an expedition reserved for experienced climbers only. Mountaineering certification or alternatively experience in high-altitude mountaineering and extreme temperature with one summit of over 6,500M to your credit is a necessity.

58,Dzo Jongo (West) Peak with Markha Valley,Ladakh,12,6,72 KM,6240 mts.,48500,Leh to Leh,"
Brief Description 

                        Hidden like a mystery in plain view, Dzo Jongo is one magical peak. Starting from Leh, the trek takes you through the magnificent and arid Markha Valley. What's fascinating is that the peak stays hidden from view till you get to it's very base - the first 5 days of the trek keep you wondering whether the mountain in question actually exists or not. Does it actually exist? Yes it does! Is it gorgeous? Based on our recent experience, we'd say every bit worth the wait! 

From the dust storms of Markha Valley to the tent-flapping winds of its basecamp at 5,500M to the snow storms during summit push, Dzo Jongo West (6260M) is the perfect recipe for adventure. It's the right amount of challenging and technical, the right mix of extreme temperatures, and requires the right combination of skill and endurance for it to make it to the top of your 'must-have' experiences.

What's fascinating about the West face of Dzo Jongo (6260M) is that it's got easy bits of straight walking and it's got extremely scary sections with 80° ice walls. It's got trekking sections and it has got sections where you need to know exactly how to use your tools. It's got sections where you'll feel like it's a cake walk and it's got sections that will make you cry. This magnificent peak can get you brimming with self-confidence and just when you thought you got this, it throws something at you which will fill you with self-doubt. It's an extremely confusing internal and external journey but it's worth every bit of the conundrum for its spectacular views and the amount of learning it offers.

59,Ghepan Ghat Lake Trek,Himachal Pradesh,5,4,28 KM,4146 mts.,11700,Sissu to Sissu,"
Brief Description 

Tucked away like a well-kept secret in the fascinating terrain of Lahaul, this 5-day trek is the right balance of a few bits of thrill with heaps of chill - all on the road less traveled (literally). This relatively easy trail, which hasn't been walked by many trekkers, takes you through narrow shepherd trails and holds all the features of a leisurely trek with neuron-activating view. Imagine ice hangs casually in the middle of a neon blue glacial lake in the backdrop of massive meadows littered with all kinds of colours.
Years after having traced the trail frequented by gaddis (shepherds) in the region, we led our first batch to this electrifying high-altitude glacial lake in July of 2021. Galvanic blue water, thick icebergs floating aimlessly around, and a carpet of colourful flora got us and our trekkers swooning And we can’t wait to have more people experience what we did on this beautiful trail. Until sometime ago, reaching Lahaul was more perilous than the trek itself. Now, the Atal Tunnel has opened up a world of possibilities for trekking in the region, making Ghepan Ghat more accessible than ever before.
Originating from the remote village of Sissu which lies a couple of hours drive away from Manali, the lake rests at an altitude of 4,140M. This moderately difficult trek takes you through exposed terrain with high ascents, steep descents through extremely rugged and untouched trails hidden even from most local guides in the region.
The best time to do Ghepan Ghat trek is between May and October. Stay on this page for more information on the trek.

Brief Description 

                        One amongst the many impressive mountains in the Garhwal Himalayas, is Black Peak – the highest peak in the Saraswati Range of mountains in the Ruinsara Valley. Called Kalanag in the local dialect – named so for the uncanny resemblance of the head of the peak to the head of the black cobra – it is 6,287 M of awe-inspiring beauty. The Bandarpunch massif (also called the Saraswati range of mountains) consists of 3 peaks: White Peak or Bandarpunch II at 6,102M, Banderpunch I at 6,316M and Kalanag (Black Peak) at 6,287M. Daunting for its structure and the nature of climbing required to get to its top, Black Peak dominates the Bandarpunch massif bringing it up the ranks on every mountaineer’s list of peaks to scale.  
For the magnificent location in which it is housed, Black Peak has some of the most reverential mountains in its vicinity. All the major peaks of the Garhwal range like Swargarohini, Bhagirathi Massif, Bandarpunch, Gangotri range of mountains and many more keep you company along the trail. The trail itself, for passing through Govind National Park which is known for its diverse flora and fauna, boasts of insurmountable beauty across an assortment of landscapes ranging from alpine meadows to pine forests to moraine ridges, boulders and glacial basins. 
Black Peak offers the right mix of beauty and challenge. A technical expedition overall, the most demanding section of the climb is the 75 feet vertical ice wall with a 70 degree gradient which comes on your way to the summit. Walking across crevassed snowfields, navigating glaciers, miles of rocky moraines and the continuously thinning air of the altitude, Black Peak is an overall challenging endeavor which requires knowledge of mountaineering equipment and skills specific to surviving at this altitude. Hence, it is an expedition reserved for experienced climbers only. Mountaineering certification or alternatively vast experience in high-altitude trekking and extreme temperature is a mandate to undertake this challenging expedition.

                        If you are looking to enter the big league of the 7000ers, Mount Satopanth, as a perfect marriage of altitude and technicality is the best place to start. As the second highest peak in the Gangotri National Park in Uttarakhand, Mount Satopanth is 7,075 meters of pure beauty. Its daunting structure, unnerving slopes and unpredictable weather all lend to the strength of the peak and the thrill it offers. This handsome mountain is part of the Garhwal Range of Himalayas and its name, in the local dialect, literally translates to ‘true path’.
For what it delivers in terms of high-altitude experience, Mt. Satopanth is looked at as a holy grail for climbers who aspire to go higher up to the 8000ers. A stepping stone for some and for some a challenge in and of itself, the mountain is a thing of beauty and does its share in lending you a dream. First scaled way back in 1947 by a Swiss expedition led by Andre Roch, it is a technical climb which requires navigating difficult terrain in extremely cold temperatures and the thin air that comes with its soaring altitude.

The nature of the mountain, its crevasse- riddled surface, complex glacier approach, high angled snow slopes, patches of difficult ice and rock negotiations, technical knife ridges, constantly changing weather, high altitude and strong winds make it a demanding climb. While it is welcoming, the mountain only invites those with true grit and a heart of a team player.

Kedar Dome rests at an impressive altitude of 6,832 M. Named for its dome shaped roof, this beautiful peak which lies 2 kms northeast of the religiously significant Kedarnath Peak, takes you very close to the 7000M milestone. 
Starting from the holy mountain town of Gangotri, the trail for this climb is a stunning assortment of landscapes from the lush forests of Chirbasa to massive open grounds of Tapovan onto the glacial terrain of Kirti Glacier before hitting the icy slopes of the mountain itself. We take the standard route which is from the northeastern side of the mountain since it poses fewer challenges as compared to the more treacherous route that is from its eastern face. While altitude is one thrilling yet challenging factor to scale this beauty of a peak, it is meant for climbers looking to get a high-altitude experience with relatively less technical difficulties. 
Although only mildly technical, the climb up Kedar Dome includes having to traverse miles of rocky moraines, navigating the mighty Kirti glacier, walking across crevassed snowfields and an arduous climb up the summit in thinning high-altitude air coupled with violent winds. Given its altitude and terrain, the climb requires specific knowledge of mountaineering equipment and a specific set of skills to survive at that altitude.

Brief Description 

                        Located in Hemis National Park in the heart of Markha Valley, Ladakh, Kang Yatse I at a daunting altitude of 6,400M, is a technical peak which is also challenging in other ways. The mountain has two main summits, one of which is Kang Yatse I with the other one being Kang Yatse II which at an altitude of 6,240M is much easier and hence frequently climbed. 
As one of the highest peaks in the vast expanse of the arid terrain of Markha Valley, Kang Yatse I makes itself seen on day 6 of our trek through the valley to get to its base.  The peak is a thing of sheer beauty standing tall in the middle of this dry land of scree and loose rocks that is Markha Valley. 
Starting from the high mountain city of Leh, you are in the presence of beauty from the get-go. The drive up to Skiu, the confluence of the distinctly colored rivers - Zanskar and Indus, the occasional sighting of wildlife that’s endemic to the region, the excruciatingly dry yet gorgeous trek through Markha Valley to finally reach the slopes of this much sought after peak which is 6,400M of beauty that’s hard to ignore once you lay your eyes on it. Passing through quaint settlements scattered across this arid landscape give you a glimpse into the local culture and livelihood of the region. Religious shrines, mani walls, stupas and other signs of the faith of the land and its people, pepper the landscape. The prayer flags add to the color palette of this otherwise monochromatic backdrop. They also lend to a sense of peace to the continuously thinning air as we go up towards the higher reaches of this exquisite peak. This mud civilization is not short of old monasteries, ruined forts and abandoned structures which camouflage themselves amongst the peculiar geographical formations in the region which add to the mystery of the place.
While Kang Yatse II is a favorite amongst trekkers looking for a non-technical trekking peak, Kang Yatse I is meant for experienced mountaineers with technical knowledge, looking for a challenge. The expedition calls for some specific skills of ice and snow climbing, and excellent physical fitness in addition to high levels of stamina. With a steep summit climb, moraines, crevasses, technical boulder sections and a steep couloir that demands extreme fitness and endurance, the expedition requires the use of technical mountaineering equipment and skills suited for its terrain. The summit gives you impressive views of the renowned peaks such as Stok Kangri, Dzo Jongo and the infamous Karakoram Range of mountains.

part of the Nun Kun massif and stands confidently alongside its taller twin, Mt. Nun, which is
7,135M and the highest peak in the Zanskar region. Mt. Kun lies to the north of its cousin and
the two are separated from each other by a 4 km long snow plateau. The third highest peak in the
massif - Pinnacle Peak (6,930M) – lies to the northeast of Mt. Nun. The massif is located in Suru
valley of the Kargil district about 250 km east of Srinagar.
Himalayas are an inexhaustible treasure house to which devotees of mountaineering have come
for years to quench their thirst for exciting challenges. Amongst the many discovered and
countless undiscovered peaks, stands Mt. Kun which draws climbers from across countries, those
who aspire to go higher up to the 8000ers. A stepping stone for some and a challenge in itself for
others, the mountain is a thing of beauty and does its share in lending you a dream. First scaled
way back in 1913 (the summit of Mt. Nun happened only in 1953), its second successful summit
would only be after fifty eight long years by an Indian Army expedition in the year 1971. Mt.
Kun is a technical climb which requires navigating difficult terrain in extreme cold with throes of
violent winds being a bully - pushing you around in all directions.
The nature of the mountain, it's crevasse-riddled surface, it's very unnerving habit of changing
face every hour thereby changing routes, elaborate glacial formations, high gradient ice walls,
technical patches, knife-edge ridges, constantly changing weather, high altitude and strong winds
make it a much tougher peak to climb than some other 7,000M peaks. Mount Kun is a very
demanding peak.
Since it is a technical climb which requires specific knowledge of mountaineering equipment and
a specific set of skills to survive at that altitude in that terrain, this is an expedition reserved for
experienced climbers only. Mountaineering certification or alternatively experience in high-
altitude mountaineering and extreme temperature with one summit of over 6,500M to your credit
is a necessity.

Brief Description 

If you’re looking for a breather from your hectic work schedule and experience the peace and serenity of the mountains just over the weekend, Nag Tibba is the trek for you. It is a beginner level trek near the charming hill station of Mussoorie and is famous for its stunning sunsets from the campsite and terrific summit views. Resting at 3,022 m and spanning over 19 km, this trek is an absolute delight for all trekkers as it is open for the better part of the year and can be done by anyone with a basic level of fitness.
“Nag Tibba” means the serpent’s peak and is said to be the abode of the serpent God. This short trek is wholesome in its own way. It starts from the quaint village of Pantwari over a rocky uphill trudge and eventually envelopes into a local shepherd’s trail with gradual ascents and steep descents.
The trek runs through dense Rhododendron and Oak forests on snow clad terrain that is challenging to navigate in some sections. After trekking for about 5.5 km, the forest opens up to a small clearing with the Nag Mandir at the centre of it, offering mesmerizing views of the surrounding peaks. This is the campsite for the day.
Tip: The trek is more enjoyable when done over a span of three days instead of two. Find out why here.
Thanks to the open ground, the sunsets from this campsite are magical to behold only to have the magic surpassed by the starlit skies that follow.
Next day, the trek to the summit is steep and rugged but rewards you with glorious views of some prominent Himalayan Peaks like Swargrohini, Bandarpoonch, Black Peak &Gangotri amongst others.
And this is why the Nag Tibba trek is special. It treats you to an outstandingsummit view of an impressive range of snow-clad Garhwalian Peaks on the second day of the trek itself making it a must-do weekend winter trek in the Himalayas.
Although short in duration, the Nag Tibba trek does not fall short on the many attractions it holds. Read more about the Highlights of the Nag Tibba Trek.
